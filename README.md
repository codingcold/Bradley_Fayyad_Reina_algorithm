# Bradley_Fayyad_Reina_algorithm
Since the BFR algorithm has a strong assumption that the clusters are normally distributed with independent dimensions, we generated synthetic datasets by initializing some random centroids and creating some data points with the centroids and some standard deviations to form the clusters. We also added some other data points as outliers in the dataset to evaluate the algorithm. Data points which are outliers belong to clusters that are named or indexed as “-1”.
